# World University Rankings Analysis
## Project Overview
This project analyzes global university rankings to compare institutions across multiple metrics, identify national and regional trends, and explore the factors that impact university rankings. By examining education quality, research output, alumni employment, and faculty quality, we aim to derive insights to inform university strategies and guide national education policies.

## Data
The dataset provides a detailed comparison of universities worldwide, considering metrics such as:

Education Quality  
Alumni Employment  
Research Output (including publications, influence, and citations)  

This data enables a deep dive into university performance and the factors influencing global rankings.  

#### Dataset Source: World University Rankings on Kaggle

## Objectives
Compare Rankings Across Dimensions:  
Visualize the performance of universities based on world rank, national rank, quality of education, alumni employment, and faculty quality. This comparison will highlight areas of strength and weakness for each university in its global ranking.  

Identify National and Regional Trends:  
Using country and national rank data, analyze how different countriesâ€™ universities perform on the global stage. Identify regional trends, uncover patterns in countries with higher-ranking institutions, and explore potential areas for policy improvement.  

Correlate Rankings with Research and Influence:  
Investigate whether high-ranking universities have strong research output and influence. This analysis will focus on publications, influence, and citation metrics to see how they relate to overall rankings.  

Educational Quality and Employment:  
Examine how the quality of education metric correlates with alumni employment rankings. This will provide insight into the connection between education quality and graduate employability.
